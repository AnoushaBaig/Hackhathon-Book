# Physical-AI-Humanoid Robots

Welcome to the Physical-AI-Humanoid Robots - a comprehensive guide to the intersection of artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics. This Docusaurus-powered website provides in-depth coverage of AI robotics concepts, applications, and implementation.

## About This Book

This book covers the fundamental concepts and practical applications of AI robotics, including:
- AI fundamentals (machine learning, deep learning, neural networks)
- Robotics concepts (kinematics, sensors, path planning)
- AI-robotics integration (perception, decision-making, control systems)
- Real-world applications across various industries
- Development tools and methodologies
- Ethical considerations and future trends

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at http://localhost:3000. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
